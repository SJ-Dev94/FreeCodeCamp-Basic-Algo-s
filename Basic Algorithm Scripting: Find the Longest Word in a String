/*
We have a function findLongestWordLength with a parameter of str to take inputs. We initialized a counter
because we need to keep track of the current longest word. Below that we are declaring variable x to
str.split(' ') which will take the input given to our parameter, split it up and toss it into an array.
After that, we're running a forEach loop on x with a parameter of i. Below that we have some simple logic
if counter is less than the length of our parameter (in this case it since we are running a loop, the parameter
would be looping over the array of x). If this is true, we're assigning counter to i.length. Once that's done
we just return counter inside the function. EZPZ

*note* figure out why you cant use a === to assign counter to i.length

function findLongestWordLength(str) {
  let counter = 0;
  let x = str.split(' ');
  
  x.forEach(function(i) {
    if (counter < i.length) {
      counter = i.length;
     }
  });
  return counter;
