/*

We have a function truncateString that takes 2 arguments, str (a string of your choice) and num, which represents the
index at which we should splice the string and add "...". We define two variables here for brevities sake. X, which is declared
as str.split('') and j which is x.length + 1. We don't need to do this but it allows it to make our if
statements 1 liners so we're friggin doin it dudio. Now onto our logic. If x.length is equal to the value given to num 
OR if num is greater than x.length, we're returning str as is. No changes needed. If x.length is greater than num,
we're splicing x beginning at num, and ending at j (x.length + 1). Simple stuff eh? From here, once our logic is established
we're simply joining together x (remember, we split it up which puts it into an array) and adding ... 
Problem solved!

function truncateString(str, num) {
  // Clear out that junk in your trunk
  let x = str.split('');
  let j = x.length + 1;
  
  
  if (x.length == num || num > x.length) { return x.join(''); }
  if (x.length > num) { x.splice(num, j); } 
 
  return x.join('') + '...';;
} 

truncateString("A-tisket a-tasket A green and yellow basket", 8);
