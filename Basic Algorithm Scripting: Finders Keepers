/*

We have a function findElement that has two parameters, arr, which in this case is for an array, and func, which is for
a function defined below. We also have declared the variable num, which is set to 0. Then we have a for loop where we have a
a variable set to If i is less than arr.length, we're running incrementing i. After this, we are assigning num to arr[i]. 
Then we just have some simple logic. if func with num as its argument is true, simply return num.

 for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

  return;
